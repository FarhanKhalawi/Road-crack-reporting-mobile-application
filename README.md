# üõ£Ô∏è Road Crack Reporting ‚Äì Bachelor Project 2024

##  Overview
This project introduces a **mobile and web-based system** to modernize and streamline how **road cracks** are reported in Norway.  
Instead of relying on outdated methods (such as calling 175 or using municipal websites), the solution provides a **mobile app, AI-based crack validation, and an admin dashboard**.  
It is developed as part of the **Bachelor‚Äôs Thesis at the University of Agder (2024)**.
